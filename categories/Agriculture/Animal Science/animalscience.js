populateItems("cardview-parent","Animal Ecology And Behavior","Do you think that climate and animal behaviours play a significant role in successful hunting? The data sets provide you all the information about the environmental conditions, for instance the river-level, air temperature, hunting seasons, locations etc. The information provides you a rough idea how the environmental conditions are related to the hunting activities and animal behaviours. If you are interested, then you should not miss the chance of knowing these!", "https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?p=C1597928934-NOAA_NCEI&pg[0][gsk]=-start_date&m=-7.801055068926801!-25.734375!1!1!0!0%2C2&fs10=Animal%20Ecology%20And%20Behavior&fsm0=Animal%20Science&fst0=Agriculture","../../../Images/animal_ecology_and_behavior.jpg");

populateItems("cardview-parent","Animal Manure And Waste","In this section, we will be seeing how the gases like methane produced from animal manure affect the environment. Other than that, we will be seeing also how animal manure can be used for fertilisations and all the chemical compositions like nitrogen and phosphorus obtained from the dungs. These play a significant role in creating an environmentally-friendly solution of re-using the wastes.", "https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?p=C1597928934-NOAA_NCEI&pg[0][gsk]=-start_date&m=-7.801055068926801!-25.734375!1!1!0!0%2C2&fs10=Animal%20Manure%20And%20Waste&fsm0=Animal%20Science&fst0=Agriculture","../../../Images/animal_manure_and_waste.jpg");

The data set will provide you the information you need to access the carbon flux associated with the animal livestocks, for example the feed intake of the animals, animal manure management and so on.
