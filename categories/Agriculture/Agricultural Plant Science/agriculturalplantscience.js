populateItems("cardview-parent","Cropping System","Have you ever heard of the depletion of soil nutrients? It simply means that the nutrients in the soil become less over time, consumed by the plants. Hence, people have devised effective cropping systems to ensure that the soil nutrients do not deplete. One of the ways is planting different crops with different nutritional requirements so there are sustainable recovery periods. Other than that, you can find the optimal methods of increasing the yields here! These are deduced from the data of chemical composition of the soils.","https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?p=C1597928934-NOAA_NCEI&pg[0][gsk]=-start_date&m=-7.801055068926801!-25.734375!1!1!0!0%2C2&fs10=Croppping%20Systems&fsm0=Agricultural%20Plant%20Science&fst0=Agriculture","../../../Images/cropping_system.jpg");

populateItems("cardview-parent","Irrigation","Have you ever wondered how we plant the crops at places with less rainfall? Here’s the answer! Irrigation is a process of watering the crops with a fixed amount of water at specific intervals. Besides growing the crops, irrigation can revegetate the disturbed soils in some dry areas and maintain the landscape. Is irrigation really that magical? Let’s have a look at the data sets and explanation to give you a good visualization and understanding! The data set will provide you with the data obtained from the satellite regarding the climate and geographical location. These are the huge factors that affect irrigation.", "https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?p=C1597928934-NOAA_NCEI&pg[0][gsk]=-start_date&m=-7.801055068926801!-25.734375!1!1!0!0%2C2&fs10=Irrigation&fsm0=Agricultural%20Plant%20Science&fst0=Agriculture","../../../Images/irrigation.jpg");
