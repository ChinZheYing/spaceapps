populateItems("cardview-parent", "Ocean Temperature", "Temperature is the measure of warmth or coldness of an object. This section contains data on temperature of the ocean. A fun fact here : Cold water is denser than the hot water and hence the temperature decreases going down the ocean. However, variations in the ocean temperature will determine the species living in that particular area and the climate of the environment. To explore more, you can explore the available data sets with great visualization images.", "https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?fsm0=Ocean%20Temperature&fst0=Oceans", "../../../Images/ocean_temperature.jpg");
