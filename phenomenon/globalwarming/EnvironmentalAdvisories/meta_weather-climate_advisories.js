For instance, the chemical compositions in the atmosphere, the light intensity and distribution obtained from the satellite, and the presence of lightning using geostationary satellites. These give us a better understanding about the air in the atmosphere, helping us to detect the climate. Some indicators like air pollution index are used for analysis purposes.

Click the link, you will be presented with data sets and analysis telling you about the weather forecasting, for example, forecasting the weathers and climates using the data collected from satellites, ground precipitation and sedimentation. The data provides a visualization of the trend on how the weather changes over time. Radar technology is used to detect the ions and particles in the air corresponding to specific climate and weather.
