populateItems("cardview-parent","Tropospheric Ozone","The troposphere is the closest layer of the atmosphere to the ground. Ozone levels in this layer are much lower than they are in the stratosphere, making it an important greenhouse gas and air pollutant. It can be detrimental to the growth of crops and accelerates the ageing process. In this app, you can see how its effects are visualised through our algorithms. The data collected by various organisations will be used to calculate the severity of the aforementioned effects.", "https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?fs10=Tropospheric%20Ozone&fsm0=Air%20Quality&fst0=Atmosphere","../../../Images/tropospheric_ozone.jpg");
populateItems("cardview-parent"," Sulfur Oxides","Common sulfur oxides include sulfur dioxide and sulfur trioxide, both of which are harmful to living organisms. To understand how industrial activity correlates with the levels of sulfur oxides, try this app out! We have interesting illustrations to show you the mechanisms based on third-party data on the composition of the atmosphere.", "https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?fs10=Sulfur%20Oxides&fsm0=Air%20Quality&fst0=Atmosphere","../../../Images/sulfur_oxides.jpg");
populateItems("cardview-parent"," Carbon Monoxide","Heard of poisoning before? Carbon monoxide is one of the gases putting your life at stake. However, carbon monoxide does more than that. To discover the underlying truth, knowing how carbon monoxide can affect the air quality dramatically, explore the data sets available here with great visualizations and explanations! As an opening, depletion of the ozone layer is related to carbon monoxide, contributing to global warming.", "https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?fs10=Carbon%20Monoxide&fsm0=Air%20Quality&fst0=Atmosphere","../../../Images/carbon_monoxide.jpg");
populateItems("cardview-parent","Nitrogen Oxides","Nitrogen oxides are initially beneficial for plants but environmental problems soon arise when there is an excessive amount of nitrogen oxides in the atmosphere. Hence, to understand the concentration of the nitrogen oxides, for instance nitrogen monoxide and nitrogen dioxide, These data sets are the best equipment for meaningful exploration. You can discover the interesting reaction between nitrogen oxides and the atmosphere layer here.", "https://search.earthdata.nasa.gov/search?fs10=Nitrogen%20Oxides&fsm0=Air%20Quality&fst0=Atmosphere","../../../Images/nitrogen_oxides.jpg");
